			<p>"[SOUND] There are many applications for HTML character entity references, however in this lecture, I will concentrate only on a particular problem that the entity references can solve for us. Since HTML uses certain characters for its syntax, we need a way to differentiate between those characters as HTML and those same characters as content. If we want the browser to interpret special HTML characters as regular content, we need a way to escape them. In other words, we need a way to tell the browser not to interpret them asHTML.

Specifically, there are three characters that should always be escaped to make sure they don't cause rendering issues, either right away or down the line. And these characters are the following. The < character, the > character and the &. Instead of using the < character, you should use the HTML entity which starts with & and then followed by lt;. So if you put in your HTML, &lt;, what the browser will interpret this as a < character. And similarly, for the > character, it's &gt;. And for the & it is &amp;. So let's take a look at some HTML to see this concept in action.
